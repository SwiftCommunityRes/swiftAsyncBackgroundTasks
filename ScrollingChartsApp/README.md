## Add horizontal scrolling to Swift Charts



Apple introduced SwiftUI Charts at WWWDC 2022, which makes it incredibly easy to
create charts within SwiftUI views. The default chart presents the entire data in the
chart plot regardless of how much data is available. It can be beneficial to show
more details on a chart and add the ability to scroll through the chart.
