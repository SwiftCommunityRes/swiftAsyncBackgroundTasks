## CircularSliderWithChatGpt4 is a test iOS app in SwiftUI generated with chatGPT


This app was developed to see what 
<a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a>
could do to create a custom Circular Slider component in SwiftUI.

ChatGPT was asked to regenerate its response 10 times and none of the samples of code just
worked as expected. Some samples came very close, so I focussed on one sample
(Circular Slider 5).

Circular Slider 5a addressed the UI issue with the thumb control displaying incorrectly.

Circular Slider 5b addressed the issue of the component being fixed size.

There are still some outstanding issues regarding overall size of the Circular Slider
and how it will extend outside of the frame in which it is placed, but this could be
addressed in a number of ways.

Overall, ChatGPT cannot just generate code that can be used without question, but it
can generate code that can be examined, reviewed and tweaked to work in SwiftUI
development.

All this code was generated with [ChatGPT] version 4 - so it will be interesting to
see where this goes in the next version of ChatGPT.
