## ArraySlice with range operator and Prefix in Swift


The Swift standard library provides an ArraySlice to work with a subset of a larger

Retrieving the first few elements of a collection can be achieved using the one-sided
range operator, but is safer to use the prefix method without having to worry about
an index out of range exception.

This iPad app visualises ArraySlices using range operator and Prefix method.
