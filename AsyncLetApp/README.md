## AsyncLetApp to run background tasks in parallel in Swift


Swift Asynchronous Programming is a method of writing code that allows certain tasks
to run concurrently, rather than sequentially. The async/await syntax was introduced
in Swift 5.5 at WWDC 2021. This app demonstrates use of "async let" is used to run
multiple background tasks in parallel and wait for their combined results.
